# About Me
Hello there, I am Edward Tang, I have passion for technology and Data Science. My passion for the field wasnâ€™t fully realized until colleagues identified Data Science practices in my work as an [undergraduate research assistant](http://danceneuroscience.kch.illinois.edu/people). As a research assistant, I processed motion capture recordings, motion capture model development, and data analysis. 
    
In my spare time, I help first time PC builders by tailoring parts for their workloads and troubleshoot computer issues on community chat servers and tech forums. As a Server Moderator for Illini Esports, I assist the admin team primarily by researching and implementing bots that enhance the experience and security for over 2,000 users. My other duties include working with the team to draft the constitution for our organization, as well as, coordinating server changes with community events led by community leaders.

# About This Blog
The primary purpose of this blog is to document my experiences working on Data Science and Technology projects. I had previously shared links to notebooks on Github, but I encountered limitations that hindered some of my visualizations and explanations.
