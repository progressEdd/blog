During the weeks that lead to the tournament, Stanley handled the funding requests for the pizza, while I planned the tournament (organizing TVs, Nintendo Switch Consoles, controllers and adapters). On the day of the tournament, I served as the Tournament Organizer, managing the bracket and calling people to their sets. We had a great turn out!

As part of the Illinois Residential Experience, I serve as the leader of a community, upholding community standards, emergency procedures, and incidents on and off duty. I answer questions, concerns, and feedback through interactions with residents. Based on these interactions, I developed strategies and policies to improve the residential experience with my staff and supervisor. \n        <br><br>\n        In my last year at Scott Hall, I served as a Coach, mentoring newly hired Resident Advisors for summer training. At the end of each training day, I would host a session recapping polices and procedures covered previously, then I would answer any questions, concerns, or feedback my group had.\n        <br><br>\n        A notable experience included hosting the first Scott Halltimate Tournament. This occurred when many of my residents shared interests in the newly released Super Smash Bros Ultimate. During duty, I would frequently interact with residents on the third and forth floor who would play together. After getting survey on how many people would be interested, I worked with Stanley Chiang to plan and prepare a tournament in the lobby. During the weeks that lead to the tournament, Stanley handled the funding requests for the pizza, while I planned the tournament (organizing TVs, Nintendo Switch Consoles, controllers and adapters). On the day of the tournament, I served as the Tournament Organizer, managing the bracket and calling people to their sets. We had a great turn out! In fact we ran out of pizza within the first couple of hours with almost 50 players in the bracket and spectators there to cheer on their friends.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"container right\">\n    <div class=\"content\">\n      <h2 class=\"bold-text large-font\">Director of Moderation</h2>\n      <p class=\"centered-text small-text\">Illini Esports · Part-time <br> Jul 2019 - Aug 2021 · 2 yrs 2 mos <br> Champaign, Illinois </p>\n      <p>As a Director of Moderation, I lead a team of four moderators making final decisions regarding member conduct and bot selection. With the Vice President of Community and other Moderators we refined the internal procedures for handling conduct cases.

I also evaluated suggestions by members of the staff and moderation team considering the benefits and drawbacks of such bots. \n        <br><br> As Server Moderator, I was responsible for researching bots that would help increase community engagement.
