We chose 3 meters as it is the best sampled portion of the walk for analysis and was consistent with past studies. I wrote this in hopes that this would be used in future studies so that a researcher would not need to calculate by hand when verifying and picking a section of the recording.\n  \n\n# Import libraries for processing\n* pandas for the dataframes\n* random for simulation\n* glob for importing files\n\n# General Function That Calculates and Outputs Differences\nIn this function, all files in with the tsv extension in the same directory as this notebook file are loaded into a list called ```filenames```, after being loaded into the list, the first for loop iterates through the ```filenames``` list and makes a ```dataframes``` list with all the tsv files converted into Pandas DataFrames.\n\nThe Function takes an input called ```marker```, which is used to indicate which column we are interested in.\n\nThe we use the second loop to iterate through the ```dataframes``` list. In each iteration, the difference between the first and last indicies of right heel is calculated and stored in the ```diff``` variable. Next we initialize a dictionary ```d``` that has the current filename (```filenames[i]```) and the calculated difference (```diff```). At the end of the iteration, the dictionary entry will be appended to a list called ```data```.  \n\nAt the end of the function , the DataFrame ```df_all``` is returned giving a DataFrame with the file name and calculated displacement for each row\n\n# Functions For Calculating Differences\nThis is the function calculates the difference of the first and last rows of a dataframe.\n\nThe inputs are a dataframe and a string for the column we are interested in. I called it ```marker``` because in our case we are dealing with marker values\n\nThis function calculates the difference of the first and last rows of a the walk. \n\nThe function is an adaptation of the logic Andrea wrote for calculating the amount of distance walked based on the position data\n\nI added a second conditional for cases where the difference is negative\n\nExample for TDP MS W MRI 001 10MWT2014223mmatlab.qtm \n1. Get the starting position xi (=2717.08) of the right heel\n2. Calculate the difference d by subtracting 3000mm from xi (because 3m=3000mm) d=2717.08-3000=-282.92mm \n3. Get the finish position at the end of the crop section of the right heel xf (=-321.77)\n4. If xf doesn’t equal d then check the exact difference. For example d=-282.92mm and  xf=-321.77 get the difference between them –38.85.\n5. The exact difference will now be 3000+38.85=3038.85mm which equals 3.038m\n\n# The Actual Function in use\nTo use ```walkDisplacement```, place all raw tsv files into the same directory as this notebook, next, input the column name of the marker you are interested in. The following example will use the right heel\n\n### IF YOU GET A ```KeyError```, THAT MEANS THE MARKER YOU INPUTTED DOES NOT EXIST ON IN THE TSV COLUMNS\n\n# Sample Data Tests\nI made a sample data set to test the initial difference function\n\nThis was a simulated data set I generated to test the metercalc function for values over 0\n\nAndrea's example\n\nThese lines of code were to test out the .iloc function, I tried it here first before implementing it to the difference function\n\n# Test cases for the function\nBelow are tests I ran to check the accuracy of the functions\n\nI wrote this test case initially to see if my difference function outputted the correct value\n\nthe intial value was 1 and final value was 9, the difference that should be outputted is 8 = (9-1)\n\nI wrote this test case to check the metercalc function was outputting the correct value given random data that is in the ranges of 1000-6000\n\n# Testing ways to import the data\nI wanted to make a dataframe that outputted the values, this is still under construction.\n\nRight now it is a for loop that takes a list of dataframes, runs the metercalc function on each entry and outputs a dataframe of the calculations. this section is my tests I did to make the general function\n\nIf I am given more time, I will turn this into a function that can take all the tsv files in a directory, convert them into dataframes, and make a list of all the dataframes that will be processed\n\nI did some research and found a \n<a href=\"https://honingds.com/blog/read-multiple-data-files-into-pandas/\"> page</a> that showed how to import files and load it into a data frames\n\nI asked for some help from sigpwny and rats_irl helped me write some code based on the link I showed to him\n\n```filenames``` is a variable that stores a list of the tsv files of a directory\n\n```dataframes``` is a list\n\nthe for loop iterates through ```filenames``` and for each entry, and converts the tsv files into dataframes\n\nwith this I can make a general function\n\n## Checking The Outputs of filenames and dataframes\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n<h1>Table of Contents<span

href=\"http://danceneuroscience.kch.illinois.edu/\">Neuroscience of Dance in Health and Disability Laboratory</a>, I was tasked with verifying that the recorded section of motion capture data of the participant had truely traveled 3 meters. We chose 3 meters as it is the best sampled portion of the walk for analysis and was consistent with past studies. I wrote this in hopes that this would be used in future studies so that a researcher would not need to calculate by hand when verifying and picking a section of the recording.\n  \n\n# Import libraries for processing\n* pandas for the dataframes\n* random for simulation\n* glob for importing files\n\n# General Function That Calculates and Outputs Differences\nIn this function, all files in with the tsv extension in the same directory as this notebook file are loaded into a list called ```filenames```, after being loaded into the list, the first for loop iterates through the ```filenames``` list and makes a ```dataframes``` list with all the tsv files converted into Pandas DataFrames.\n\nThe Function takes an input called ```marker```, which is used to indicate which column we are interested in.\n\nThe we use the second loop to iterate through the ```dataframes``` list.

For example d=-282.92mm and  xf=-321.77 get the difference between them –38.85.\n5. The exact difference will now be 3000+38.85=3038.85mm which equals 3.038m\n\n# The Actual Function in use\nTo use ```walkDisplacement```, place all raw tsv files into the same directory as this notebook, next, input the column name of the marker you are interested in. The following example will use the right heel\n\n### IF YOU GET A ```KeyError```, THAT MEANS THE MARKER YOU INPUTTED DOES NOT EXIST ON IN THE TSV COLUMNS\n\n# Sample Data Tests\nI made a sample data
