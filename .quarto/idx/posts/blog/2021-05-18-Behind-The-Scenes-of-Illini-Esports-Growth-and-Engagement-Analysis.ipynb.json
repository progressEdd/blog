last 28 days\n\n# ETL on Growth and Activation\n\n## Messing around with date time\n\n### Loading the library\n\n### Datetime example\nI grabbed this example from [astrostats.psu](https://astrostatistics.psu.edu/su07/R/html/base/html/format.Date.html). The Berkely Stat Dates page [Dates and Times in R](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/dates.html) was a great reference for the code and values for datetime\n\n| Code | Value                             |\n|------|-----------------------------------|\n| %d   | Day of the month (decimal number) |\n| %m   | Month (decimal number)            |\n| %b   | Month (abbreviated)               |\n| %B   | Month (full name)                 |\n| %y   | Year (2 digit)                    |\n| %Y   | Year (4 digit)                    |\n\n### Tests to investigate how to extract date time\nThese were scuffed tests I used to learn how to extract the date time\n* the variable `test` made me realize removing `+00:00` and replacing it with a `Z` would make the data in a format that can be read by R\n* the variable `test2` was my attempt to try getting it for an entire column\n\nWhile performing my tests, I struggled understanding format of the date was in, a search of a [2021-03-27T00:00:00+00:00 datatype](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=2021-03-27T00%3A00%3A00%2B00%3A00+datatype&t=ffab&ia=web) pointed me to a stack overflow page that helped me learn more about python functions [Date Time Formats in Python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17594298/date-time-formats-in-python).\n\n### Testing substring removal\n* with a understanding of what I needed to make it possible, I moved on to learn about substring replacement. This took a long time to figure out and understand.\n\n#### Removing the plus sign\na search of [R remove all text after plus sign](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=R+remove+all+text+after+plus+sign&t=ffab&ia=web) helped me break through this barrier I found that this answer on stackoverflow was particularly helpful in removing the `+` sign [How to remove + (plus sign) from string in R?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35807737). gsub seemed to be the recommend choice among all answers\n\n#### Removing the rest of zeros\nI found the following stackoverflow answer that had a example for how to remove the rest of a string [Remove all text before colon](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12297991). I couldn't remember how to remove everything after the + so the following example from stevencarlislewalker's blog was particularly helpful in refreshing my memory [Remove (or replace) everything before or after a specified character in R strings](https://stevencarlislewalker.wordpress.com/2013/02/13/remove-or-replace-everything-before-or-after-a-specified-character-in-r-strings/)\n\n## Removing +00:00Z from the whole column\n\nthese were tests I ran to automate this for all the datetime rows.\n\n### split the `interval_start_timestamp`\nOnce I got it working on a row, I applied what I learned above to extract the year, month, and day from the initial datetime object\nLater when I was generating the bar charts, I had issues ordering the data by calendar months, a quick search yielded [Sorting months in R](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9769735) I learned that passing `months` into `factor` with the `levels = month.name` would allow me to sort by the months\n\n## Making the new dataframe\n\nAfter making the split dataframes, I used a cbind to append the columns to the original dataset and reordered the dataset.\n\n## Testing if I could change the months to become a factor\n\n## Extracting date time\n\nrun the following cell to extract year, month, day\n\n### Joins extraction\n\n### Sources extraction\n\n### Leaves extraction\n\n### Messages extraction\n\n### Voices extraction\n\n### Communicators extraction\n\n## Identifying Covid vs Normal Time Periods\n\nThe following modifications are my attempts to identify covid years for our analysis, I could edit the csv, but I decided to explore R to practice etl for larger datasets. The Fall 2017 STAT 200 course page on [Regression With Factor Variables](http://courses.atlas.illinois.edu/fall2017/STAT/STAT200/RProgramming/RegressionFactors.html) was particularly helpful as a reference when I was trying to have R use `Covid` as the default factor instead of `Normal`, having `Covid` as the default factor will be important when I generate the linear models and interpret the outputs. I would also recommend reading the berkley stats page on [\"Factors in R\"](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/factors.html) to get a deeper understanding of how to convert factors with dates\n\n\nI could have applied the `relevel()` to the `as.factor` line as seen in this stack overflow answer [How to force R to use a specified factor level as reference in a regression?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47815709), but I realized it was much easier to read/run the code in my head line by line than to pass into multiple functions\n\n# Data Needed For Investigation\nThe following cells are the final processed data that will be used for analysis\n\n## Historical data\n\n## Last 28 days\n\n# Data Aggregation\n\n## subsetting by year\n\nOriginally I planned on aggregating by the year for my bar charts, but when I read through some more examples of aggregates, I found a better method in \"Aggregating by category\"\n\n## Aggregating by year\n\n### 2019\n\n### 2020\n\n### 2021\n\n## Aggregating by month\n\n### 2019\n\n### 2020\n\n### 2021\n\n## Testing aggregations\nThis section includes my initial tests for data aggregation. In the next section I learned a easier to read method to aggregate multiple variables.\n\n## Aggregating by category\n\nAs mentioned in the subsetting by year section, upon reading some examples for aggregating in R, I found that there was a method to aggregate by multiple columns. The following article [\"Aggregate in R\"](https://r-coder.com/aggregate-r/) was particularly helpful as it had sample code with useful outputs. The second option of using R linear model notation is a bit more intuitive than the first suggestion.\n\n```\naggregate(df_2$weight, by = list(df_2$feed, df_2$cat_var), FUN = sum)\n# Equivalent to:\naggregate(weight ~ feed + cat_var, data = df_2, FUN = sum)\n\n```\n\n### Joins\n\n### Leaves\n\n#### Experimental 3d agg\nI was curious to see what would happen if I were to add another dimension of `days_in_guild`. I ended up not using it as it would be hard to visualize with a chart.\n\n### Sources\n\nI tried aggregating the various sources. Our group later realized we could get the same data from another file. So this ended up being unused.\n\n### Communicators\n\n# Visualizations\n\nI realized that using R's base plots were not going to make the cut. I recall that when I was searching for graphing solutions on a different project, I found an appealing graph solution with ggplots. At the time I was using python, so ggplot wasn't a library supported. In another class, the professor introduced ggplots. I could have used excel to generate the plots, but I wanted a learning opportunity to try ggplot on something that wasn't homework or classwork. I knew I needed a stacked bar chart as I needed to compare the changes across the months and years.\n\nAfter a search on the web, I found the following guide [\"How to Create and Customize Bar Plot Using ggplot2 Package in R- One Zero Blog\"](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-and-customize-bar-plot-using-ggplot2-package-in-r-4872004878a7) on the towards data science medium to be particularly helpful, as there was sample code with outputs. I used the sample code from section on bar labels on a stack bar plot as a base and made modifications to fit my data.\n\n## all joins\n\nTo make it easier for me to input the parameters and give me a sanity check for my graphs, I loaded all the aggregate data.\n\nI started by substituting the sample parameters with my own dataset. I quickly realized that the graph had some issues on the x axis. The month names were overlapping.\n\nAfter searching the web, I found a great stack overflow answer [How to maintain size of ggplot with long labels](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41607201) that ultimately influenced the final graphs.\n\nWhen I first made the graphs, the order of the x axis was backwards from a normal year. For the presentation I used the version above, but when I came back for the final report and final write up, I decided to search for a solution. I knew previously that `coord_flip()` was the cause of the initial reversed order. Searching [ggplot coord_flip() change order of x axis](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ggplot+coord_flip()+change+order+of+x+axis&t=ffab&ia=web) found the answer I was looking for. The following answer from [Reversed order after coord_flip in R](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34271060) was had the solution I was looking for. I learned that I could use a limits parameter to change the order, as passing `scale_x_discrete()` with out any parameters wouldn't change my graph.\n\nUltimately this is the final version of the graph. For the report, I scaled the horizontal dimension to be 1920 and had the aspect ratio fixed.\n\n## All leaves\n\nI decided to also make a graph for leaves, but it was ultimately scrapped because our analysis was more focused in the new user changes. Perhaps we can return to analyze the leaves\n\n## All communicators\n\n# Multiple Models Excluding Effect of Year\n\nThis section contains the code for generating linear models for the other variables we were interested in. I followed my professor's notes for setting up the parameters. For fun I decided to experiment with the messages dataset, as it included an additional variable of `messages_per_communicator` which gives a bit more granularity in comparing between individuals and aggregates for messages.\n\n## New members linear model\n\n## Total messages linear model\n\n## Messages experiments\n\n### Including messages_per_communicator in full model\n\n### Including messages_per_communicator in full model\n\n## Voices linear model\n\n## Communicators linear model\n\n# Testing Year Effect\nAfter our group presented our project, our professor was concerned that there was confounding variables that the anova test had not factored in. Thus for our final report, we generated multiple regression models\n\n## New members multiple regression model\n\n## Total messages multiple regression model\n\n## Voices multiple regression model\n\n## Communicators multiple regression model\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n<h1>Table of Contents<span class=\"tocSkip\"></span></h1>\n<div class=\"toc\"><ul class=\"toc-item\"><li><span><a

Engagement by last 28 days\n\n# ETL on Growth and Activation\n\n## Messing around with date time\n\n### Loading the library\n\n### Datetime example\nI grabbed this example from [astrostats.psu](https://astrostatistics.psu.edu/su07/R/html/base/html/format.Date.html). The Berkely Stat Dates page [Dates and Times in R](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/dates.html) was a great reference for the code and values for datetime\n\n| Code | Value                             |\n|------|-----------------------------------|\n| %d   | Day of the month (decimal number) |\n| %m   | Month (decimal number)            |\n| %b   | Month (abbreviated)               |\n| %B   | Month (full name)                 |\n| %y   | Year (2 digit)                    |\n| %Y   | Year (4 digit)                    |\n\n### Tests to investigate how to extract date time\nThese were scuffed tests I used to learn how to extract the date time\n* the variable `test` made me realize removing `+00:00` and replacing it with a `Z` would make the data in a format that can be read by R\n* the variable `test2` was my attempt to try getting it for an entire column\n\nWhile performing my tests, I struggled understanding format of the date was in, a search of a [2021-03-27T00:00:00+00:00 datatype](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=2021-03-27T00%3A00%3A00%2B00%3A00+datatype&t=ffab&ia=web) pointed me to a stack overflow page that helped me learn more about python functions [Date Time Formats in Python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17594298/date-time-formats-in-python).\n\n### Testing substring removal\n* with a understanding of what I needed to make it possible, I moved on to learn about substring replacement. This took a long time to figure out and understand.\n\n#### Removing the plus sign\na search of [R remove all text after plus sign](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=R+remove+all+text+after+plus+sign&t=ffab&ia=web) helped me break through this barrier I found that this answer on stackoverflow was particularly helpful in removing the `+` sign [How to remove + (plus sign) from string in R?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35807737). gsub seemed to be the recommend choice among all answers\n\n#### Removing the rest of zeros\nI found the following stackoverflow answer that had a example for how to remove the rest of a string [Remove all text before colon](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12297991). I couldn't remember how to remove everything after the + so the following example from stevencarlislewalker's blog was particularly helpful in refreshing my memory [Remove (or replace) everything before or after a specified character in R strings](https://stevencarlislewalker.wordpress.com/2013/02/13/remove-or-replace-everything-before-or-after-a-specified-character-in-r-strings/)\n\n## Removing +00:00Z from the whole column\n\nthese were tests I ran to automate this for all the datetime rows.\n\n### split the `interval_start_timestamp`\nOnce I got it working on a row, I applied what I learned above to extract the year, month, and day from the initial datetime object\nLater when I was generating the bar charts, I had issues ordering the data by calendar months, a quick search yielded [Sorting months in R](https://stackoverflow.com/a/9769735) I learned that passing `months` into `factor` with the `levels = month.name` would allow me to sort by the months\n\n## Making the new dataframe\n\nAfter making the split dataframes, I used a cbind to append the columns to the original dataset and reordered the dataset.\n\n## Testing if I could change the months to become a factor\n\n## Extracting date time\n\nrun the following cell to extract year, month, day\n\n### Joins extraction\n\n### Sources extraction\n\n### Leaves extraction\n\n### Messages extraction\n\n### Voices extraction\n\n### Communicators extraction\n\n## Identifying Covid vs Normal Time Periods\n\nThe following modifications are my attempts to identify covid years for our analysis, I could edit the csv, but I decided to explore R to practice etl for larger datasets. The Fall 2017 STAT 200 course page on [Regression With Factor Variables](http://courses.atlas.illinois.edu/fall2017/STAT/STAT200/RProgramming/RegressionFactors.html) was particularly helpful as a reference when I was trying to have R use `Covid` as the default factor instead of `Normal`, having `Covid` as the default factor will be important when I generate the linear models and interpret the outputs. I would also recommend reading the berkley stats page on [\"Factors in R\"](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~s133/factors.html) to get a deeper understanding of how to convert factors with dates\n\n\nI could have applied the `relevel()` to the `as.factor` line as seen in this stack overflow answer [How to force R to use a specified factor level as reference in a regression?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47815709), but I realized it was much easier to read/run the code in my head line by line than to pass into multiple functions\n\n# Data Needed For Investigation\nThe following cells are the final processed data that will be used for analysis\n\n## Historical data\n\n## Last 28 days\n\n# Data Aggregation\n\n## subsetting by year\n\nOriginally I planned on aggregating by the year for my bar charts, but when I read through some more examples of aggregates, I found a better method in \"Aggregating by category\"\n\n## Aggregating by year\n\n### 2019\n\n### 2020\n\n### 2021\n\n## Aggregating by month\n\n### 2019\n\n### 2020\n\n### 2021\n\n## Testing aggregations\nThis section includes my initial tests for data aggregation. In the next section I learned a easier to read method to aggregate multiple variables.\n\n## Aggregating by category\n\nAs mentioned in the subsetting by year section, upon reading some examples for aggregating in R, I found that there was a method to aggregate by multiple columns. The following article [\"Aggregate in R\"](https://r-coder.com/aggregate-r/) was particularly helpful as it had sample code with useful outputs. The second option of using R linear model notation is a bit more intuitive than the first suggestion.\n\n```\naggregate(df_2$weight, by = list(df_2$feed, df_2$cat_var), FUN = sum)\n# Equivalent to:\naggregate(weight ~ feed + cat_var, data = df_2, FUN = sum)\n\n```\n\n### Joins\n\n### Leaves\n\n#### Experimental 3d agg\nI was curious to see what would happen if I were to add another dimension of `days_in_guild`. I ended up not using it as it would be hard to visualize with a chart.\n\n### Sources\n\nI tried aggregating the various sources. Our group later realized we could get the same data from another file. So this ended up being unused.\n\n### Communicators\n\n# Visualizations\n\nI realized that using R's base plots were not going to make the cut. I recall that when I was searching for graphing solutions on a different project, I found an appealing graph solution with ggplots. At the time I was using python, so ggplot wasn't a library supported. In another class, the professor introduced ggplots. I could have used excel to generate the plots, but I wanted a learning opportunity to try ggplot on something that wasn't homework or classwork. I knew I needed a stacked bar chart as I needed to compare the changes across the months and years.\n\nAfter a search on the web, I found the following guide [\"How to Create and Customize Bar Plot Using ggplot2 Package in R- One Zero Blog\"](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-and-customize-bar-plot-using-ggplot2-package-in-r-4872004878a7) on the towards data science medium to be particularly helpful, as there was sample code with outputs. I used the sample code from section on bar labels on a stack bar plot as a base and made modifications to fit my data.\n\n## all joins\n\nTo make it easier for me to input the parameters and give me a sanity check for my graphs, I loaded all the aggregate data.\n\nI started by substituting the sample parameters with my own dataset. I quickly realized that the graph had some issues on the x axis. The month names were overlapping.\n\nAfter searching the web, I found a great stack overflow answer [How to maintain size of ggplot with long labels](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41607201) that ultimately influenced the final graphs.\n\nWhen I first made the graphs, the order of the x axis was backwards from a normal year. For the presentation I used the version above, but when I came back for the final report and final write up, I decided to search for a solution. I knew previously that `coord_flip()` was the cause of the initial reversed order. Searching [ggplot coord_flip() change order of x axis](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ggplot+coord_flip()+change+order+of+x+axis&t=ffab&ia=web) found the answer I was looking for. The following answer from [Reversed order after coord_flip in R](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34271060) was had the solution I was looking for. I learned that I could use a limits parameter to change the order, as passing `scale_x_discrete()` with out any parameters wouldn't change my graph.\n\nUltimately this is the final version of the graph. For the report, I scaled the horizontal dimension to be 1920 and had the aspect ratio fixed.\n\n## All leaves\n\nI decided to also make a graph for leaves, but it was ultimately scrapped because our analysis was more focused in the new user changes. Perhaps we can return to analyze the leaves\n\n## All communicators\n\n# Multiple Models Excluding Effect of Year\n\nThis section contains the code for generating linear models for the other variables we were interested in. I followed my professor's notes for setting up the parameters. For fun I decided to experiment with the messages dataset, as it included an additional variable of `messages_per_communicator` which gives a bit more granularity in comparing between individuals and aggregates for messages.\n\n## New members linear model\n\n## Total messages linear model\n\n## Messages experiments\n\n### Including messages_per_communicator in full model\n\n### Including messages_per_communicator in full model\n\n## Voices linear model\n\n## Communicators linear model\n\n# Testing Year Effect\nAfter our group presented our project, our professor was concerned that there was confounding variables that the anova test had not factored in. Thus for our final report, we generated multiple regression models\n\n## New members multiple regression model\n\n## Total messages multiple regression model\n\n## Voices multiple regression model\n\n## Communicators multiple regression model\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"2021-05-18-behind-the-scenes-of-illini-esports-growth-and-engagement-analysis.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
