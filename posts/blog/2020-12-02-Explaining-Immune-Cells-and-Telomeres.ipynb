    "# Summary of The Paper\n",
    "On a small healthy population of thirty individuals with ages ranging from 60-70 year old, researchers found that hyperbaric oxygen therapy can increase telomere lengths in T helper, T cytotoxic, natural killer and B cells.\n",
    "To quote the results of the [paper](https://www.aging-us.com/article/202188/text),\n",
    "> Telomeres length of T helper, T cytotoxic, natural killer and B cells increased significantly by over 20% following HBOT. The most significant change was noticed in B cells which increased at the 30th session, 60th session and post HBOT by 25.68%±40.42 (p=0.007), 29.39%±23.39 (p=0.0001) and 37.63%±52.73 (p=0.007), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was originally excited by the results presented by the video and paper, but I vaguely remember being excited for [another promising headline](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19167-0) about the \"anxiety brain\" from [sci-show](https://youtu.be/_fVDyPdhj3U). I decided to follow the suggestion to use pubpeer to search the article [from this guide](https://www.callingbullshit.org/tools/tools_legit.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "I found the following [post on Fight Aging](https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2020/11/overhyping-the-effects-of-hyperbaric-oxygen-treatment-on-aging/). It has a alternate explanation as to why HBOT do not directly help people become younger.\n",
    "\n",
    "> It seems plausible that the same is true of cellular senescence in immune cells. Cells become senescent when they hit the Hayflick limit on cellular replication. Throughout much of life, the senescence of immune cells is likely more determined by replication pace (and thus immune challenges, the burden of infection) than by aging. And that is before we even get to the point that the authors of this paper used a less than standard measure of senescence, one for which it is possible to argue that it may or may not actually be representative of the burden of senescent cells in immune populations. Overall this data is all interesting, but I suspect that it tells us more about the poor relevance of the metrics chosen to anything other than the deeper aspects of immune function. "
