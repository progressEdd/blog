Hello there, I am Edward Tang, I have passion for technology and Data Science. My passion for the field wasnâ€™t fully realized until colleagues identified Data Science practices in my work as an [undergraduate research assistant](http://danceneuroscience.kch.illinois.edu/people). As a research assistant, I processed motion capture recordings, motion capture model development, and data analysis. 
    
In my spare time, I help first time PC builders by tailoring parts for their workloads and troubleshoot computer issues on community chat servers and tech forums.

# About This Blog
The primary purpose of this blog is to document my experiences working on Data Science and Technology projects. I had previously shared links to notebooks on Github, but I encountered limitations that hindered some of my visualizations and explanations.
