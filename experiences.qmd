      </p>
      As a AI Engineer for EY, I work on GenAI engagements which involve building LLM applications in python for clients. Such applications include RAG Chatbots, Structured Field Extraction, and LLM Agents. When I am not building GenAI apps, I do web scraping.

        <ul>
          <li>
            For a client in Banking, I lead the development of a GenAI-powered PoC to automate FACTA and CRS letter generation. I created synthetic XML datasets—enabling scalable testing without exposing sensitive data—and ingested them into BigQuery. I built a notebook interface for compliance teams to query customers and generate letters via LLMs, replacing manual workflows.

        <ul>
          <li>
            For a client in Energy, I was the lead developer of a GenAI-powered solution that enabled structured data extraction from incoming emails that would be used as part of a automated RFP response pipline through Salesforce
          </li>
          <li>
            In between projects, I was a pioneer in GPT development with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommasobabucci/" target="_blank">@Tommaso Babucci</a>. As part of the GPT Core Team, I developed GenAI use cases for business teams. For an internal team, I helped developed a Retrive Augment Generate (RAG) Chatbot that answered questions about the SAP project delivery method. I helped with the inital scraping the internal wiki pages and loaded the pages into a Azure AI search index

          <li>
             For a client in banking, I worked with a EY team to connect financial metrics with employee experience metrics. As a follow up, I started scraping employee reviews from a variety of sources (glassdoor, blind, etc).
          </li>
          <li>
            For a client in Government, I worked with a EY team to implement a qualtrics web intercept to collect feedback for state services websites.

        <ul>
          <li>
            For a client in manufacturing, I worked with a EY team to gain insights from the combination of experiential and manufacturing data. I reduced the dataset to 44 features that were used for key driver analysis from an initial 560. Furthermore, I learned how investigating distributions with high spread allowed for targeted analysis. During this project I gained a deeper understanding of Python dictionaries to cleanse categorical data.
          </li>
          <li>
            For a client in annuities, I worked with a EY team to generate insights to improve ticket prioritization from the combination of experiential and operations data. I applied glassbox variable importance to visualize the feature contribution to Net Promoter Scores. The variable importance plots not only visualized feature contribution, but also allowed reduced the amount of features we could apply a clustering analysis.

      <p class="centered-text small-text">Ameren · Internship <br> Jan 2021 - Aug 2021 · 8 mos <br> Champaign, Illinois </p>
      <p>
        As a spring Data Science intern for Ameren, I gained hands on experiences in a data science environment working as a Data Science Consultant for the company. I was tasked with becoming the expert for Missouri Energy Efficiency (MO-EE) project to lead summer interns. The project's purpose is to develop a method to effectively market energy efficiency programs to customers, as Ameren receives benefits for customers that opt into energy efficiency programs. The method to achieve effective energy efficiency program marketing is to apply machine learning and a data pipeline in Python to find customers most likely to engage in a program. 
        <br><br>
        As a summer Data Science intern for Ameren, I applied my experiences from spring to lead the MO-EE team. The goal of MO-EE was to continue development on a python data processing and machine learning pipeline. I facilitated team meetings where we discussed progress and debugged issues with the code. 
In addition to leading the MO-EE team, I was also a member of the Consequence of Failure (COF) project. The project's purpose is to generate consequence scores for risk areas on data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and Ameren’s internal data. My role was to explore, implement, and report the feasibility of new libraries for the project.

      <p>
        During my time as Graduate Resident Advisor at Daniels Hall, I continued developing my leadership and communication skills. As part of the Illinois Residential Experience, I served as the leader of a community, upholding community standards, emergency procedures, and incidents on and off duty. 
        <br><br>
        My community was a combination of upper division and international students. The amount of campus experience varied. Some residents were experts in campus resources, while others were experiencing campus for the first during the COVID-19 pandemic. During iConvos, I would check in with the resident depending on the conversation, we would talk about campus resources, career developments, and hobbies.

      <p>During my time as Undergraduate Resident Advisor at Babcock Hall, I continued developing my leadership and communication skills. As part of the Illinois Residential Experience, I served as the leader of a community, upholding community standards, emergency procedures, and incidents on and off duty.
        <br><br>For my final year as a Undergraduate Resident Advisor, my community was a combination of freshmen, sophomores, juniors,  seniors, and international students. The community was very active, as a majority had previously lived together, this made it very easy for the residents to befriend each other. It was very unique since I lived on the same floor as Jenny Villanueva, the Multicultural Advocate. Jenny's presence gave the residents another person to speak with as well as propose events.
        <br><br> A notable event occurred after learning about the residents's living arrangements during iConvos. I had learned that many were living in apartments, but none had experience cooking for themselves. To address this need I proposed a cooking event. Residents who had experience cooking were given the opportunity to teach how to prepare a dish. I worked with Jenny to get funding and the resident instructors to get food. Although the kitchen was not very spacious, we were able to use the multipurpose room to prepare the food so the kitchen would only be for cooking. There was a lot of delicious dishes that afternoon.

      <p class="centered-text small-text">University of Illinois Housing · Part-time <br> Aug 2017 - May 2019 · 1 yr 10 mos <br> Champaign, Illinois </p>
      <p>As a Undergraduate Resident Advisor at Scott Hall, I developed my leadership and communication skills. As part of the Illinois Residential Experience, I serve as the leader of a community, upholding community standards, emergency procedures, and incidents on and off duty. I answer questions, concerns, and feedback through interactions with residents. Based on these interactions, I developed strategies and policies to improve the residential experience with my staff and supervisor. 
        <br><br>
        In my last year at Scott Hall, I served as a Coach, mentoring newly hired Resident Advisors for summer training. At the end of each training day, I would host a session recapping polices and procedures covered previously, then I would answer any questions, concerns, or feedback my group had.
        <br><br>
        A notable experience included hosting the first Scott Halltimate Tournament. This occurred when many of my residents shared interests in the newly released Super Smash Bros Ultimate. During duty, I would frequently interact with residents on the third and forth floor who would play together. After getting survey on how many people would be interested, I worked with Stanley Chiang to plan and prepare a tournament in the lobby. During the weeks that lead to the tournament, Stanley handled the funding requests for the pizza, while I planned the tournament (organizing TVs, Nintendo Switch Consoles, controllers and adapters). On the day of the tournament, I served as the Tournament Organizer, managing the bracket and calling people to their sets. We had a great turn out! In fact we ran out of pizza within the first couple of hours with almost 50 players in the bracket and spectators there to cheer on their friends.</p>

I also evaluated suggestions by members of the staff and moderation team considering the benefits and drawbacks of such bots. 
        <br><br> As Server Moderator, I was responsible for researching bots that would help increase community engagement. Throughout this experience I learned about how Illini Esports operates in addition to making suggestions of how to improve operations.</p>
